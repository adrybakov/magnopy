We are writing the complex conjugate symbol :math:`^{\dagger}` instead of the
transposition symbol :math:`^T` for a few spin vectors. The reason is
that even though vector components in a cartesian basis
are real, they become complex when writing them  in a spherical basis
(see :ref:`user-guide_methods_spherical-rf` for example).
