An exception to the small-lettering rule concerns classical spin vector holders.
These are denoted by capital bold letters :math:`\boldsymbol{S}` to conform with
the usual notation.

Spin vector holders therefore carry a left super-index
to indicate unambiguously the reference frame:
:math:`^z\boldsymbol{S_i}`, or :math:`^n\boldsymbol{S_i}`, or
:math:`^f\boldsymbol{S_i}`,
