Overview
********

This section is devoted to describe in some detail several examples that can be
calculated analytically. These are

* Gamma-point solutions :math:`\boldsymbol{q}=0` solution with spins lying along the :math:`Z`-axis.
  We shall outline the general expression, and then particularize them to the
  follwing simpler cases:

  * Single atom with spin :math:`S` per unit cell.
  * Two atoms :math:`A,\, B` with same spin :math:`S` per unit cell, aligned ferromagnetically.
  * Two atoms :math:`A,\, B` with same spin :math:`S` per unit cell, aligned anti-ferromagnetically.

* Staggered solutions :math:`\boldsymbol{q}=\boldsymbol{G}/2`. The general expressions will subsequently
  be particularized to a single atom wiht spin :math:`S` per unit cell.

* Conical :math:`\boldsymbol{q}\ne 0` solutions with a single atom whose spin spirals within the
  :math:`XY` plane.

The results that will be shown can be obtained more easily starting from the vanilla Heisenberg Hamiltonian.
The examples are just intended to show that the formalism recovers known results; however some established
expressions are generalized to the case of simple anisotropies, and possibly some of those have not been
published in  the past.
