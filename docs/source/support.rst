A few ways to ask for help or give feedback exist:

*   |Forum-google-groups|_

    You may send email directly to magnopy@googlegroups.com

*   |GitHub-discussions|_

    You may need to create an account at github to post a question.

Both places are  monitored and answered by the authors, choose the one you prefer.

If you found a found a bug or want to request a feature,
then consider posting an |issue-tracker|_:

* :ref:`development_bug`
* :ref:`development_feature`.
