:math:`\hat{r}` is a unit vector, corresponding to the vector
:math:`\boldsymbol{r}` in Euclidean space:

.. math::

  \hat{r} = \dfrac{\boldsymbol{r}}{r},

where :math:`r` is a length of the vector :math:`\boldsymbol{r}`.

.. note::
  Unit vector notations coincides with the notation for the linear operators.
