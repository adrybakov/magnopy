The terms "reference frame" = "coordinate system" = "basis".

Two specific reference frames used in this documentation are
the conventional cartesian ":math:`xyz`"  and the rotated
orthogonal ":math:`uvn`" ones.
These two are spanned by the unit vectors
:math:`\{\boldsymbol{\hat{x}}`, :math:`\boldsymbol{\hat{y}}`, :math:`\boldsymbol{\hat{z}}\}`
and
:math:`\{\boldsymbol{\hat{u}}`, :math:`\boldsymbol{\hat{v}}`, :math:`\boldsymbol{\hat{n}}\}`,
respectively.
They can be written in Dirac's bra-ket notation as :math:`\vert xyz \rangle` and :math:`\vert uvn \rangle`.
