The terms "reference frame" = "coordinate system" = "basis".

This documentation uses the conventional cartesian frame ":math:`(x\,y\,z)=\ket{x\,y\,z}`"
that is spanned by the unit vectors
:math:`\{\boldsymbol{\hat{x}}`, :math:`\boldsymbol{\hat{y}}`, :math:`\boldsymbol{\hat{z}}\}`
and the rotated frame ":math:`(u\,v\,n)=\ket{u\,v\,n}`" that is spanned by the unit vectors
:math:`\{\boldsymbol{\hat{u}}`, :math:`\boldsymbol{\hat{v}}`, :math:`\boldsymbol{\hat{n}}\}`.

Reference frames are hence denoted by italic letters denoting their unit vectors, that are
enclosed either by parentheses or by bra-kets.
