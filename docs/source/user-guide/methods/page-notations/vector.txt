Classical vectors are denoted by bold small letters.
Their coordinates are written in column form. An example is

.. math::
  \boldsymbol{r} = (r^x, r^y, r^z)^T= \begin{pmatrix} r^x\\r^y\\r^z\end{pmatrix}

Arbitrary components of a vector are denoted by greek letter superindices. An example is :math:`r^\alpha`.

Exceptions are spin vectors that are denoted by capital bold letters :math:`{\bf S}` to
conform with
the usual notation.
