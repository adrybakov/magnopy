We are explicitly using complex conjugate :math:`^\dagger` instead of the
transposition :math:`^T` in the places where one would expect to see the
transposition. The reason is the following: even the real-valued quantities
can be written with complex numbers if the "complex" reference frame is used
(see :ref:`user-guide_methods_spherical-rf` for example).
