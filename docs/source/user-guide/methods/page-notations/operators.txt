The notation for the different operators appearing in this documentation is

* The Hamiltonian operator is denoted by :math:`{\cal H}`

* Spin operator vector components are written as :math:`s^\alpha`

* Vectors spin operators are denoted by

  .. math::
    \boldsymbol{\cal S}=(s^x,s^y,s^z)^{\dagger}=\begin{pmatrix} s^x\\s^y\\s^z\end{pmatrix}

* Boson operators with quantum number :math:`n` are written as :math:`a_n` or :math:`b_n`.

* Boson operators are eventually collected into vector boson operators, that are denoted by

  .. math::
    \boldsymbol{\cal A}=(a_1,a_2,\dots)^{\dagger}=\begin{pmatrix}a_1\\a_2\\\vdots\end{pmatrix}

    \boldsymbol{\cal B}=(b_1,b_2,\dots)^{\dagger}=\begin{pmatrix}b_1\\b_2\\\vdots\end{pmatrix}
