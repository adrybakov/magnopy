Magnopy is a python library and can be installed as any other python library. See the page
above for more details.

    cli/how-to-execute

We do not want to limit magnopy to users who are familiar with python. For that purpose we
prepared a number of the scripts to perform calculation with magnopy, that can be executed
as any other command line tool. Read the gide by the link above to learn how to execute a
script and then visit one of the guides below to read more about each script.

Full tutorials about magnopy are hosted on a separate web-site |magnopy-tutorials|_. Visit
it and work through the "Master tutorial" if you wish to learn magnopy. Each tutorial
offers a small set of exercises, that help to get comfortable in using magnopy.

In the pages above we provide simple guides on how to achieve a small well-define task
within magnopy. Those "How to ..." guides are written based on the questions that users
are asking about the code. If you do not see the how-to guide that answers your question,
please do not hesitate to ask it via our :ref:`support` channels.

It is important to understand how any tool operates and what it does exactly. In the pages
above we prepared some explanatory material about theory behind magnopy.
