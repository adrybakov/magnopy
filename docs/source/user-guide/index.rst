Magnopy is a python library and to get the most of it it one need to use it as one.
Nevertheless, we do not want to limit it accessability only to the ones who is familiar
with python. For that purpose we introduce a number of the scripts that perform
calculation with magnopy and can be executed as any other command line tool.

To get your started with magnopy we prepared a number of guides. Every one of them shows
how to achieve a particular goal using magnopy.

With any tool it is important to understand what it does exactly, both for the
interpretation of results and for the good quality research. Here we prepared some
explanatory material about theory behind magnopy.

First of all, at the heart of magnopy there is a spin Hamiltonian.In the following pages
we explain how the Hamiltonian is defined and how is it stored within magnopy.
