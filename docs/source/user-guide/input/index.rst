********************************
Specification of the input files
********************************

Central piece in any magnopy run is a spin Hamiltonian file. Here we present full and
formal specification of such file for the intrinsic magnopy's format (both
human-readable and binary). Alternatively magnopy can read the spin Hamiltonian from
tb2j. We recommend to
:ref:`convert TB2J's file into the magnopy's txt file <>`
as it will allow for more flexible input modifications (i.e. the spiral states can be
specified).
