Data structures (overview)
**************************

Magnopy has a number of data structures defined, that take care of a relatively
separated concepts. Two of them are inherited from the |wulfric|_ package (:ref:`user-guide_usage_cell`
and :ref:`user-guide_usage_atoms`). Some are used to store the parameters of spin Hamiltonian
(:ref:`user-guide_usage_spin-hamiltnonian` and :ref:`user-guide_usage_notation`). And some represents levels of theory and
serve as a collection of the things that can be computed (:ref:`user-guide_usage_lswt`, :ref:`user-guide_usage_energy`).
