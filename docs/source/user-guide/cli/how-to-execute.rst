***********************
How to execute scripts?
***********************

On this page we explain how the command-line interface of magnopy works.

A number of command-line scripts is defined in magnopy. Name of every single one of them
starts with ``magnopy-``. Examples on this page use ``magnopy-scenario`` as a placeholder
for the script's name.

.. _user-guide_cli_common-notes_help:

Getting help
============

To display the help message and check what parameters are available for each script use

.. code-block:: bash

    magnopy-scenario --help

See :ref:`user-guide_cli_common-notes_read-help` to read more about help messages.

.. _user-guide_cli_common-notes_arguments:

Arguments
=========

Every script expects some "arguments" (or "parameters" or "options") as an input. There
are three types of arguments.


.. _user-guide_cli_common-notes_arguments_positional:

Positional arguments
--------------------

Only the *value* of an argument is expected. Script recognizes its meaning based on the
position of that value within the command.

For example, assume that a script expects two positional arguments:

- first argument with the name of the input file;
- second argument with the name of the output file.

If you execute

.. code-block:: bash

    magnopy-scenario input.txt output.txt

a script will use the file "input.txt" as an input file and write output to the
"output.txt" file. However, if you execute

.. code-block:: bash

    magnopy-scenario output.txt input.txt

then "output.txt" will be used as an input file and output will be written to the
"input.txt" file.

.. important::

    Order of positional arguments matters.

.. _user-guide_cli_common-notes_arguments_keyword_with_value:

Keyword arguments with value
----------------------------

Both the *keyword* and the *value* (one or several) of an argument are expected. The
keyword is fixed and indicates the meaning of the argument. The value is the data that are
passed to the script. Keyword arguments are given *after* positional ones. Order of
keyword arguments does not matter.

For example, assume that a script expects an argument with the keyword ``--input-file``,
that requires a single value. If you execute

.. code-block:: bash

    magnopy-scenario --input-file input.txt

then "--input-file" is a keyword and "input.txt" is the value.

Next, assume that a script expects an argument with the keyword ``--magnetic-fiel``, that
requires three values. If you execute

.. code-block:: bash

    magnopy-scenario --magnetic-field 0 0 1

then "--magnetic-field" is a keyword and "0", "0" and "1" are the values. In this example
the values describe components of the magnetic flux density :math:`B = (0, 0, 1)`.

.. important::

    The keywords always start with "-" or "--".

.. _user-guide_cli_common-notes_arguments_keyword_without_value:

Keyword arguments without value
-------------------------------

Only the *keyword* is expected. The keyword is fixed and indicates both the meaning of the
argument and its value. This type of arguments is typically used when the argument has
only two possible values: ``True`` or ``False``. When such an argument is given to
the script it switches the default value to its opposite.

For example, assume that a script expects an argument with the keyword ``--relative`` and
default value ``False``. If you execute

.. code-block:: bash

    magnopy-scenario

a script will use ``False`` as a value for the argument with the keyword ``--relative``.
However, if you execute

.. code-block:: bash

    magnopy-scenario --relative

then a script will use ``True`` as a value for the argument with the keyword
``--relative``.

.. important::

    The keywords always start with "-" or "--".


.. _user-guide_cli_common-notes_long_vs_short:

Long vs short keywords
======================

Majority of arguments in magnopy's scripts have two equivalent keywords: a long one and a
short one. You are free to use either of them. The long version of the keyword starts with
``--`` and the short version of the keyword starts with a single ``-``.

The purpose of having both long and short keywords is to provide descriptive keywords
(i. e. "long" ones) and to allow experienced users an option of using the short ones.

For example, assume that a set of arguments is defined for a script

==================== ============= ==============
Long keyword         Short keyword Value
==================== ============= ==============
``--input-file``     ``-if``       One string
``--output-file``    ``-of``       One string
``--magnetic-field`` ``-mf``       Three numbers
``--relative``       ``-r``        No value
==================== ============= ==============

Then, two following commands are equivalent

.. code-block:: bash

    magnopy-scenario --input-file input.txt --output-file output.txt --magnetic-field 0 0 1 --relative

.. code-block:: bash

    magnopy-scenario -if input.txt -of output.txt -mf 0 0 1 -r

The first one is descriptive and the second one is compact.

.. hint::

    You can use long keywords for some of the arguments and short ones for the other. The
    arguments are independent in this context.


.. _user-guide_cli_common-notes_read-help:

How to read help message
========================

Assume that you executed a command

.. code-block:: bash

    magnopy-scenario --help

and the script printed in the terminal the following

.. code-block:: text
    :linenos:

    usage: magnopy-scenario [-h] -if FILENAME -of FILENAME [-mf h_x h_y h_z] [-r]
