This script optimizes classical energy of the spin Hamiltonian and finds spin directions that describe a local minima of the energy landscape.

  -ss, --spinham-source {GROGU,TB2J,tb2j,grogu}
                        Magnopy supports two sources of spin Hamiltonian:
                        GROGU or TB2J. Source of the spin Hamiltonian can not
                        be deduced reliably from the Hamiltonian file. Thus,
                        magnopy asks you to specify what was the source of the
                        file that you pass to "--spinham-filename".
  -sf, --spinham-filename FILENAME
                        Path to the file with the parameters of spin
                        Hamiltonian. If you use "--spinham-source TB2J", then
                        this is an "exchange.out" file, produced by TB2J. If
                        you use "--spinham-source GROGU", then this is a .txt
                        file with the Hamiltonian parameters produced by
                        GROGU.
  -et, --energy-tolerance ENERGY_TOLERANCE
                        Tolerance parameter. Difference between classical
                        energies of two consecutive optimization steps.
  -tt, --torque-tolerance TORQUE_TOLERANCE
                        Tolerance parameter. Maximum value of torque among all
                        spins at current optimization step.
  -s, --supercell xA_1 xA_2 xA_3
                        Definition of the supercell for the spin optimization.
                        Expects three integers as an input, each integer is a
                        multiple of the original unit cell along one of the
                        three lattice vectors. By default optimizes on the
                        unit cell.
  -mf, --magnetic-field B_X B_Y B_Z
                        Vector of the external magnetic field (magnetic flux
                        density, B), given in the units of Tesla.
  -of, --output-folder OUTPUT_FOLDER
                        Path to the folder where all output files of magnopy
                        wil be saved. Defaults to "magnopy-results". If the
                        folder does not exist, then magnopy will try to create
                        it.
  -sv, --spin-values [S1 ...]
                        Only works with "--spinham-source TB2J". This option
                        changes spin values of the magnetic atoms. It expects
                        M numbers in the same order as the order of magnetic
                        atoms in the input TB2J file. Magnetic atoms are
                        defined as the atoms that have at least one
                        interaction associated with them. Spin values are
                        always positive. If you want to specify spin-down
                        state or AFM order use spin directions and not the
                        spin values.
  -no-html, --no-html   .html files are generally heavy (~ 5 Mb). This option
                        allows to disable their generation to save disk space.
  -hpd, --hide-personal-data
                        Whether not to use os.path.abspath. Hides the file
                        structure of your personal computer. Note, that the
                        relative paths can still expose the structure of you
                        filesystem.
  -msdi, --make-sd-image MAKE_SD_IMAGE MAKE_SD_IMAGE MAKE_SD_IMAGE
                        DEPRECATED in v0.2.0. Interactive .html images are
                        generated by default, use "--no-html" to suppress.
                        This arguments will be removed from magnopy in March
                        of 2026
