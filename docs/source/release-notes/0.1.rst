Whats new?
----------

First release of magnopy.

0.1.1
-----

**Date**: 20 May 2025

*   Fix a bug with the energy units. In the output "eV" was written instead of "meV".
    Now it is written "meV". The values were always outputted in meV.

*   Replace GROGU interface for the temporary simpler one.

0.1.2
-----

**Date**: 20 May 2025

Change colors in the plots.

0.1.3
-----

**Date**: 22 May 2025

*   Start to use the term "convention" istead of "notation" both in documentation and in
    the code.

*   Add ax.set_xlabel() for the plot with the custom list of kpoints.

*   Change development status from planning to beta in pyproject.toml

*   Remove total energy from the output. It was not really meaningful, as it was summed
    along the high symmetry path and not across the Brillouin zone. In other words that
    number was incorrect to be outputted from the very beginning.
