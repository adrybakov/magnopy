Whats new?
----------

First release of magnopy.

0.1.4
-----

**Date**: 23 May 2025

*   Fix a bug in the TB2J reader. Atom's positions were read as absolute instead of relative.
    Now they are read as relative, as it should be.

* Fix various bugs in the vampire output.

0.1.3
-----

**Date**: 22 May 2025

.. warning::
    We recommend not to use this version.

*   Start to use the term "convention" istead of "notation" both in documentation and in
    the code.

*   Add ax.set_xlabel() for the plot with the custom list of kpoints.

*   Change development status from planning to beta in pyproject.toml

*   Remove total energy from the output. It was not really meaningful, as it was summed
    along the high symmetry path and not across the Brillouin zone. In other words that
    number was incorrect to be outputted from the very beginning.

0.1.2

Change colors in the plots.

0.1.1
-----

**Date**: 20 May 2025

.. warning::
    We recommend not to use this version.

*   Fix a bug with the energy units. In the output "eV" was written instead of "meV".
    Now it is written "meV". The values were always outputted in meV.

*   Replace GROGU interface for the temporary simpler one.
