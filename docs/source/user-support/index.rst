We offer two main channels for communication.

Github
======

There are two main places for the communication on github


*   |GitHub-discussions|_

    You can post general questions, discuss magnopy's results and everything else.
    Github discussions have similar scope to |Forum-google-groups|_.

*   |GitHub-issues|_

    Github issues are more specific. Issues should be used if you want to
    :ref:`propose a feature <user-support_feature>` for magnopy or suspect that you
    :ref:`encountered a bug <user-support_bug>`.

        features
        bugs

Forum at google groups
======================

You may send email directly to magnopy@googlegroups.com or post you question on the
|Forum-google-groups|_.

If you became a member of the magnopy's google group, then you shall receive e-mails
that announce new releases of magnopy.



.. note::

    You may need to create an account at github to post.
